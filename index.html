      <p>Hi! I'm Tim Watters, and I'm a game design and development enthusiast. I'm about to finish my
        bachelors degree in Animation and Game Design from Curtin University, and I'm ready to move on to bigger
        projects.
        Below you'll find an assortment of my personal projects, built using different engines such as the
        <strong>Unreal</strong> and <strong>Godot</strong> engines. I've also done some 3D work in
        <strong>Blender</strong> and in <strong>Maya</strong>. I also have some programming experience in
        <strong>Java</strong>, <strong>C#</strong>, and <strong>C++</strong>. And lastly I coded this website! So
        I'm familiar HTML, CSS, and <strong>JavaScript</strong>.

      <h2>Coin Dash</h2>
      <p>I call this first project Coin Dash. It was created in <strong>Godot</strong> using <strong>GDScript</strong>. <br>
        To get started with this engine, I followed a course by Packt. The assets are not my own, being taken from Packt
        resources. Even though I began by following a course, the course was out of date with the current version of
        Godot at the time that I decided to embark on my journey. I also made variations to the original code in ways I
        believed improved the original gameplay. I had to develop fundemental game coding skills in this project.</p>

      <h2>Escape Maze</h2>
      <p>This next project is called Escape Maze. This was also built in the <strong>Godot</strong> engine using
        <strong>GDScript</strong>. <br> This was also based on a project by Packt. As such, the assets are not my own.
        Similar to in Coin Dash I took the premise offered by the Packt tutorial and extended it. Trying to find
        creative uses for the different components created an interesting challenge that I enjoyed solving. I learned
        how to use sprite sheets in Godot, and developed my skills in a different work flow, learning how to group
        assets and build 2D games based on layers.

      <h2>Space Rocks</h2>
      <p>Space Rocks was also built in <strong>Godot</strong> using <strong>GDScript</strong>. <br> This project was also
        based on the Godot project book from Packt that the pevious Godot projects were from. As such, the assets aren't
        mine. Moving on to more fun things though, I had a lot of fun with this project. I made sure to follow the book
        less closely with this one to try and practice the skills I'd picked up so far, but to also see how much I could
        figure out from subheadings. This project was very fun, and I learned a lot in 2D physics while developing this
        game.</p>

      <h2>Marble Maze</h2>
      <p>Marble Maze was my first project built in <strong>Unreal</strong>. I used the <strong>Blueprint</strong> system
        to program it.<br> The system tilts the maze based on mouse movement and got me started with using physics in 3D
        space. The assets are default assets from the Unreal starter content.</p>

    <div class="grid-right row-11">
      <h2>Marble Run</h2>
      <p>Marble Run was also made in <strong>Unreal</strong> using <strong>Blueprint</strong>. <br>The moving camera in the
        project allowed me to make more interesting choices in the level design. I could also improve my skills in the
        prototyping and rapid mockup of levels when using Unreal. It felt like this project did a lot to refine existing
        skills and practices from previous projects.</p>
